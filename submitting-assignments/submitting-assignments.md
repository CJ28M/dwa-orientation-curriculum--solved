# Sample repo Assignment

In this lesson, you will go through the step-by-step process from obtaining a local copy of an assignment to solving it and submitting it for grading by the mentor team. You'll also receive feedback to guide you further.

You'll learn how to set up a test environment, use remote GitHub Repositories to publicly store and share your code with other developers. This involves keeping the remote repository synchronized with your local copy, testing your solutions, reading terminal output, pushing local repository changes to the remote repository, and maintaining a clean repository history.

Please make sure to follow each step provided by the instructor, as the next assignment involves submitting the results of your work.
